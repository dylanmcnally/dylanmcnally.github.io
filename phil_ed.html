         	<h1>What is education?</h1>
			<p>
				Or is it ‘what is an education’? To educate or to be educated? If you say the word “education” enough times it starts to sound foreign. Yet, people love to talk about education. There is the various governmental entities focused on education, private and public institutions, general and higher education. Some teenagers and young adults obtain several tens of thousands of dollars of debt, just for a few letters behind their name, just to ‘get an education’. When you think about it enough, the whole idea of ‘education’ sounds fairly silly.

			<h1>Define it.</h1>
			<p>Dictionary.com defines education as “the act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgement, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually for mature life”. Take notice of ‘preparing...for mature life’. Reading this quote, I am led to believe that education is one step in becoming an adult. It is some unpleasant task that I must complete if I want to go out into ‘the real world’. And once I hit ‘mature life’, whenever that begins, I stop. Because how can one prepare for a period of life that he is already in? The more I think about education, the more I get lost. I start to develop these questions in my head and once again, the word ‘education’ sounds so foreign and quite obscure.
			</p>
			<p>When I was in middle school, I knew I would attend college. I wasn’t completely sure what college entailed, but I knew that ‘if I wanted to be successful in the real world, I needed an education’ and ‘that’s what smart kids do’. In middle school, no one tells you that what you actually need to get a job is a degree, and that many successful people, such as Steve Jobs, didn’t graduate from college. However, as a kid, this is what education meant: going to school and getting good grades. In this environment, it is easy to get washed away with all of the have-to's and lose sight of the want-to's. In my time at CU Boulder, I have been able to grow into chasing my dreams, instead of what I am supposed to do.</p>

	      		<p>So this is where I find myself. I have found my passion in experimental physics. The great thing about working in experimental physics is that no one, absolutely no one, takes themselves too seriously. I have had the immense pleasure of working in the Regal Group in the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics. Each of my lab mates has more fun with physics than any "work" environment I have experienced. As graduate students, they don't get paid very well and they work long hours. Yet, they are some of the happiest, most well-rounded people. My philosophy of education has developed from my experiences in the community of the Engineering Honors Program combined with witnessing the true joy that people have in their work. My philosophy of education is rooted in a deep fascination, like a child in a candy store. Learning is driven by curiosity, which I believe is driven by fascination. The picture that lies to the left is indeed a curious choice to include on a page about education. I chose to connect that picture with these thoughts because in that moment, snowshoeing near Nederland, CO with my family, I was perfectly joyful. My brother had just pushed me over into the snow as we threw snowballs and messed around. Quite simply, we were having fun. For me education is about having fun and exploring your fascinations.
